# Loading tranSMART data

## For all data types
* Parameters for all data types
  * [study-params.md](study-params.md) - Study level parameters regarding security, study ID and top node.
* Metadata
  * [tags.md](tags.md) - Loading study, concept, patient metadata and links to source data per concept.

## Low-dimensional data
* Clinical data
  * [clinical.md](clinical.md) - Loading numerical and categorical low-dimensional data from clinical, non-high throughput molecular profiling, derived imaging data, biobanking data or links to source data per patient.
    * [word-mapping.md](word-mapping.md) - Redefine categorical values, without changing the source data.
    * [ontology-mapping.md](ontology-mapping.md) - Map variables to ontology codes to create standardized cross-study concepts.
    * [trial-visit-mapping.md](trial-visit-mapping.md) *not yet implemented* - Provide a time unit and value for your trial visit labels.
    * [patient-visit-mapping.md](patient-visit-mapping.md) *not yet implemented* - Provide start and end dates for your patient visits.
    * [templates.md](templates.md) - Using templates in the clinical data paths.
    * [xtrial.md](xtrial.md) - Uploading across trial clinical data for pre-2017 versions of tranSMART.

## High-dimensional data
* General high-dimensional data processing
  * [hd-params.md](hd-params.md) - Parameters that are supported for all high-dimensional data types.
  * [chromosomal_region.md](chromosomal_region.md) - Tabular file structure for loading chromosomal regions.
  * [subject-sample-mapping.md](subject-sample-mapping.md) - Tabular file structure for loading subject sample mappings for HD data.
* mRNA gene expression data
  * [expression.md](expression.md) - Loading microarray gene expression data.

* Copy Number Variation data
  * [cnv.md](cnv.md) - Loading CNV data from Array CGH (comparative genomic hybridisation), SNP Array, DNA-Seq, etc.
* Small Genomic Variants
  * *not yet implemented* - Loading small genomic variants (SNP, indel in VCF format) from RNAseq or DNAseq.
* Proteomics data
  * [proteomics.md](proteomics.md) - Loading protein mass spectrometry data as peptide or protein quantities.
* Metabolomics data
