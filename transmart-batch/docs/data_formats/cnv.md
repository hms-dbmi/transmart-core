# CNV

## Platform Upload

Your platform configuration file has to have the `cnv_annotation.params` name.
The content of the params file is the same as for other HD data types.

For format of the platform data file see [chromosomal_region.md](chromosomal_region.md)

## CNV Data Upload

Uploading CNV data requires a `cnv.params` file.

For generic HD parameter see [hd-params.md](hd-params.md).

Specific to this data type is the following parameter:

- `PROB_IS_NOT_1` _Default:_ `ERROR`. `ERROR` for failing when encountering a probability not summing up to one.
`WARN` for logging the error and continuing.


Data file format
----------------
The first column has to be region name,  The rest of the columns are recognised by the name, not by position.
Replace `<sample_code>` with an actual sample code defined in your [subject-sample mapping](subject-sample-mapping.md) (e.g. `CACO2`). The columns that contain the copy number state probabilities are not required, but if present in a row, all these columns should be filled in.

| Column Name | Description |
--------------|--------------
| region_name | **(Mandatory)** The name of this region as defined in your [annotations file](chromosomal_region.md) (e.g. `WASH7P`) |
| `<sample_code>`.flag | **(Mandatory)** Copy number state of. Possible values are: `-2` - homozygous loss, `-1` - loss `0` - normal, `1` - gain, `2` - amplification. |
| `<sample_code>`.chip | log2 ratio of the measurement. |
| `<sample_code>`.segmented |  Segmented log2 ratio. |
| `<sample_code>`.probhomloss | Probability of homozygous loss. |
| `<sample_code>`.probloss | Probability of loss. |
| `<sample_code>`.probnorm |  Probability of normal. |
| `<sample_code>`.probgain | Probability of gain. |
| `<sample_code>`.probamp | Probability of amplification. |
